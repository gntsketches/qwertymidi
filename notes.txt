> Write Walmik: write midi time signatures and bpm

- does not handle syncopations very well... er... at all...
    hmmm...
    - *does* bpm affect quantization?... #85 was recorded at 120 vs #84 at 60

- sometimes the metronome beat just stops...
- shortcut for record start/stop
- woodblock sound for metronome
- switch sounds (more metronome sounds too)
- change note octaves
- polyphonic!

structure:
    - maybe pressQwerty logic should be a container for Qwerty?
    - where to put download logic?
        - maybe in a container for Download button?
