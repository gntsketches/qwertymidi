TODO

- fix everything with the synthesizers
- bpm apparently *does* affect quantization... #85 was recorded at 120 vs #84 at 60
- double check that quantization selections actually do that
- get qwerty to light up
- grey download box when there's no download
- bpm selector disables qwerty notes on focus



structure:
    - maybe pressQwerty logic should be a container for Qwerty?
    - where to put download logic?
        - maybe in a container for Download button?


how much functionality do i want here?
    - switch sounds
    - change note octaves
    - write midi time signatures and bpm
    - disable qwerty sounds in


        (check out the stacatto quarter notes in MuseScore...?)
            this seems to be on MuseScore's end. the "length" of all notes is 64.
